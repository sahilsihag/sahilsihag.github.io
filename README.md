## sahilsihag.github.io

Source for my personal website. Built with Jekyll, hosted using Github Pages and modified according to my requirements/taste. See [credits](https://sahilsihag.github.io/credits/) for more info.

To preview locally, use:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

#### Notes:
- No need to specify `JEKYLL_ENV=production` for Github Pages, takes care itself.
